                The best dance/circuit party I've been to in DC. The sound
                quality and DJ were absolutely incredible. It starts pretty tame
                and then gets progressively more wild throughout the evening.

                DC's "queer" dance party (where a tiny vodka soda is $20),
                people really go all out with their outfits/looks, the music can
                be hit or miss. I last went in Fall 2024 and it felt like it was
                falling off a little.

                Gay event organizer - they do insane circuit party stuff around
